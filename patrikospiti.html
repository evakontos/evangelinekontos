					<p id="caption">Oil paint on stretched canvas, 22" x 28"</p>


					<br>

					<p>"Patriko Spiti" was completed as a final project for my Painting course at Binghamton University. The oil painting could be done on a subject of choice, using any painting methods or styles, on a 22" x 28" stretch canvas. My painting, "Patriko Spiti", is a portrait of my maternal grandparents in Greece from the 80s. My mother moved to the US from Greece in the 90s, and pictured here is one of her last Easter's spent with her parents in Greece, casually relaxing and listening to music outside, while roasting lamb on a spit. I wanted to depict a portrait that would represent my roots- to demonstrate the relaxed, humble lifestyle that my family lived in Greece, far different from the one that I live today. I take pride in being Greek and wanted to embrace my culture and lifestyle that constitutes for a strong part of my identity. I also wanted to dedicate a painting to my grandmother, the most fun-loving and lighthearted person I knew, who passed away 11 years ago in 2009.</p>

					<p>My grandfather, pictured in this painting, passed away in November of 2021, 6 months after the painting was completed. It gives me great happiness to know he was able to see this painting before he passed.</p>
